		<p>We will build an inclusive community of trans and queer people through art, connection, thought, and compassion. We seek to transform the Willamette Valley into a safe space for all people. We will accomplish this by aligning our actions with these values:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We heal each other by radiating kindness toward ourselves, our chosen family, our community, and the earth.</li>
				<li>We embrace difference, change, and ambiguity.</li>
				<li>We celebrate the joy of being alive and revel in the freedom of self-expression.</li>
				<li>We speak, listen, and act with passion, deliberation, respect, and nuance.</li>
				<li>We show dignity for those present and those absent.</li>
				<li>We believe in the power of kindness, humor, and beauty to transform ourselves, each other, and humanity.</li>
				<li>We expand, shattering the limits placed on us and positively defy external expectation.</li>
				<li>We experiment and try new approaches to creating solutions.</li>
				<li>We draw from the despair and darkness of our lives as a source of power to create hope and light.</li>
				<li>We honor the process of self-transformation and support growth in whatever way aligns best with each individual.</li>
				<li>We take a long view, slowing time to savor each moment without expectation of immediate reward.</li>
				<li>We reject productivity at the expense of people and the planet.</li>
				<li>We share the gifts we have been privileged to receive.</li>
				<li>We forgive ourselves and others when we fail to follow these values and provide space and opportunity to learn and grow from missteps, rather than punitive action.</li>
