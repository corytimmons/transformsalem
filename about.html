	<h1>who we are</h1>
		<p>We are a collective of trans and queer artists and allies in the Salem, OR area. We seek to build an inclusive community through art, connection, thought, and compassion. We seek to transform the Willamette Valley into a safe space for all people. We will accomplish this by aligning our actions with these values:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We heal each other by radiating kindness toward ourselves, our chosen family, our community, and the earth.</li>
				<li>We embrace difference, change, and ambiguity.</li>
				<li>We celebrate the joy of being alive and revel in the freedom of self-expression.</li>
				<li>We speak, listen, and act with passion, deliberation, respect, and nuance.</li>
				<li>We show dignity for those present and those absent.</li>
				<li>We believe in the power of kindness, humor, and beauty to transform ourselves, each other, and humanity.</li>
				<li>We continously expand, shattering the limits placed on us and positively defying external expectation.</li>
				<li>We experiment and try new approaches to creating solutions.</li>
				<li>We draw from the despair and darkness of our lives as a source of power to create hope and light.</li>
				<li>We honor the process of self-transformation and support growth in whatever way aligns best with each individual.</li>
				<li>We take a long view, slowing time to savor each moment without expectation of immediate reward.</li>
				<li>We reject productivity at the expense of people and the planet.</li>
				<li>We share the gifts we have been privileged to receive.</li>
				<li>We forgive ourselves and others when we fail to follow these values and provide space and opportunity to learn and grow from missteps, rather than punitive action.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>If you share these values and wish to share your talent or inclusive community event, please contact us. We're always looking for new friends.</p>
