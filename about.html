	<h1>who we are</h1>
		<p>We are trans and queer people and allies in the Salem, OR area seeking to build an inclusive community through art, connection, thought, celebration, and compassion. Our goal is transform the Willamette Valley into a safe space for <em>all</em> people to thrive.</p>
		<p>We do not believe that events should be placed behind paywalls or on platforms created by corporations conducting seurvillance on our activities. We disagree with the notion that organizers should have to pay a fee to list their events publicly. We provide virtual space here for folks to advertise their inclusive events so all are welcome, not just those who participate in certain platforms.</p>
		<p>Transform Salem was started and initially funded by a transgender artist who grew up in Salem. She was fed up with not being able to connect with other trans and queer people because she didn't use <span class="redacted">facebook</span>. You can learn more about her <a href="http://www.corytimmons.com">here</a>, if you're curious.</p>
